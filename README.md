#### Exercise 01 - CLI navigation

#### how to `cd` to root directory 

- Well I didn't know about `/` is the root directory which is the top level directory on Unix/Linux/Mac operating system

- a `ls` doesn't tell you much about those files and directories but purely names of files and directory in the current directory you are in

- so you can add a couple of arguments with ls to gain more information about each item in the directory
- well I don't know about `h`
	- after my `man ls`, I know it is `-h, --human-readable`

#### Exercise 02 - Work with files and directories with command `touch`, `mkdir`, `mv`, `cp`, `rm`

		nothing new

#### Exercise 03 - Read contents of files with `cat`, `head`, `more`, `less`, `tail`

		`tail` allows you to go forward one line with the down arrow, backward one line with the up arrow

		backward and foward a page with the page up and page down keys

		to exist, you can press `q`

#### Exercise 04 - read manpages with a command `man`

		- The "<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">SYNOPSIS</mark>" section describes the available flags
		- for example, `touch` can be used any order , file is the last argument
		- The "<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">DESCRIPTION</mark>" section provides an overview of possible options
		- also, I didn't know `man` command actually uses `less` to display the content of the manpages, so we can use up-down arrow key or page-up and page-down key to navigate the contents of the manual
		- or use `j` and `k`
